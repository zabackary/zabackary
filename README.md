## Hello there!

Who am I? I'm not really sure; go explore my code!

Much of my work is in private repositories, so nothing much to see here. Maybe check out the chess clock firmware I wrote or xkcd viewer?

### I made [vexmason](https://github.com/zabackary/vexmason), the VEX V5 Python bundler.

### Go try playing a game I made! [The Christian Story](https://zabackary.github.io/the-christian-story)

### I'm part of VEX VRC HS team 99484
